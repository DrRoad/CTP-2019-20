# Streetview Ripper

Streetview Ripper will automatically download Streetview spheres from a user-provided list of URLs and save the results to a png. A range of image quality levels are available. 

This tool is intended for offline image research purposes - the downloaded images should not be distributed. All rights to all Streetview imagery remain with Google.
