## About StreetviewRipper

StreetviewRipper is a tool designed to be able to automatically generate a large dataset of cloud imagery. A build is available within the "Builds/StreetviewRipper" directory. To use it, open Google Maps, find a decent Streetview sphere, copy the URL, and paste it into the tool's textbox.

You can choose to recurse into neighbours (this will find neighbours of the photo sphere, and keep automatically going using those), or alternatively if you want to curate the results manually, you can post multiple Streetview links into the textbox (each on a new line) and disable recursion, so the tool will work through your URLs instead of automatically picking new ones.

Optionally, image processing can be disabled - this will just download the regular Streetview LDR images without performing any processing. The set up instructions above only need to be followed if you plan on enabling image processing. If you are just downloading LDR images, the tool works standalone.

If image processing and recursion is enabled, you can set the number of neighbours to skip. This will provide you with a more diverse processed dataset, as instead of processing direct neighbours, the tool will skip a given number of neighbours before selecting a new photo sphere to process.

To stop execution, press the "stop" button. The tool will stop execution once operations on the current image have completed.

## Using DeepDoodle

DeepDoodle is included with the project for deep learning. A tool is available within "Builds/DeepLearning" which can configure your DeepDoodle environment and manage training/launching the doodler program. When you first launch the tool, enter your Visual Studio VC bin directory and CUDA version directory, then press save.

If you have collected a cloud dataset using StreetviewRipper, you can now press "Start Training". This will launch a command prompt window showing you progress - it will take some time to complete based on the number of images you have collected.

A pre-trained DeepDoodle model is available in the "DeepLearning/Pre-trained" folder. To use it instead of training on your own data, copy it out into the root "DeepLearning" folder.

With your training complete (or pre-trained model copied) you can now press "Launch Doodler" to interact with the network in realtime.


## Additional notes

The C# MATLAB API can sometimes crash after a series of calls - for this reason, the branch "matlab-local-fix" was created, which automatically opens MATLAB and runs the script within the program rather than through the API. This is useful for generating a large dataset of processed images. You will need to adjust the MATLAB path in code and recompile StreetviewRipper to utilise this fix, found on the "matlab-local-fix" branch. Check that the branch is not behind master before using it (may have fallen behind, merge it to update).
