  2. Install CUDA 9.1 (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-91-download-archive)
  3. Download cuDNN 9.1 (v7.0.5) (https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive)
    - You will need to make an account and fill out a survey before you can download.
    - Unzip the file and navigate into the 'cuda' folder.
    - Copy the 3 folders there (bin, include, lib) and paste them in
      'C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.1' where you installed CUDA.
  4. Finally, you can run 'DeepDoodle.exe'. No install required; it runs standalone.
